                  Dear visitor,
                  <BR><BR>
                  We are softly launching this website while it's in progress; over the next year, we will be migrating content from the School for Poetic Computation's old website and <a class="citation cit-1">building out our archive</a><sup>(1)</sup> of programs, projects, publications and community members.
                  Our URL change from sfpc.io to sfpc.study is an embrace of a vision of our school as "<a class="citation cit-2">a place where we explore computation, but computation isn't the point</a>."<sup>(2)</sup> Our old website now lives at <a href="https://legacy.sfpc.study">legacy.sfpc.study</a>...

                  <a class="expand-intro"><BR><BR>Keep reading</a>
                </p>


                <div class="expanded-intro hide-expanded">

                        The first thing you might notice is this website has two modes.
                        By default, you've entered into cathode-ray mode —inspired by the displays of early CRT computers—, but you can switch into
                        liquid crystal (LCD) mode at any time through the footer fixed to the bottom as you scroll.
                        The default being a dark mode is a counter to "<a class="citation cit-3">the positioning of white as neutral within interfaces</a>,"<sup>(3)</sup>
                        a positioning which this website turns in on itself.
                        <!-- The CRT mode has a funky type treatment inspired by Alec Lownes; the LCD mode can update with each program's theme. -->
                        <BR><BR>
                        <!-- <img src="images/space/9.jpg" class="img-4"> <img src="images/space/11.jpg" class="img-4">   -->
                        <img src="images/space/0.jpg" class="img-4">
                        If you've ever visited SFPC's <a href="about-space.html">previous space</a>, in the Westbeth Artists Community of the West Village NYC, you'll remember four large windows in front of the courtyard. It's where you may have peeked into before an event, or where you may have stood in front of to take a group picture at the end of your session.
                        The <a class="citation link-show-grid">four column grid</a> of this website, and its black frame through which the poetics of relation is realized, is inspired by those four prominent floor to ceiling windows.
                        <BR><BR>
                        <img src="images/sfpc-logo-variations.jpg" class="img-4"> Something tender about those windows is how participants and visitors would leave on them visual iterations of "school for poetic computation" over the years, refiguring the identity of the school through post-its, hand lettering and hand drawn sketches.
                        The notion of "<a class="citation cit-4">poetic computation" belongs to everyone</a>,<sup>(4)</sup> and in a similar vein, within the header of this website is a cycling through of various definitions of "poetic computation" as contributed by people in our community.

                    <!-- I contributed a definition I remember nervously babbling during a "Meet the Participants" event at the beginning of the Fall 2019 session,
                    the day after I sat with Laolu, Tsige, Galen, Neta and Melanie on the floor of Koenig Clinton, as we listened to Fred Moten read his poetry aloud.
                    Fred said "resistance is making yourself into a conductive thread." Later, I responded,
                    "poetic computation is an act of resistance against utilitarian notions of progress and efficiency." -->

                    "Poetic computation begins with the interfacing between two or more beings" is a definition that resonates.
                     <!-- because I'm reminded of the first circuit I made (ever?) for Che-wei & Taylor's hardware class where Fran and I made 2 LEDs light up by high-fiving each other. -->

                    This website holds within itself that particular yearning of interfacing, as we continue into our third round of online classes this Spring.
