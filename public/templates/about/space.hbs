                                        SFPC does not currently have a physical location. Since Spring 2020, we've been online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From 2015 to 2020, we were located in the Westbeth Artists Community in the West Village of New York City, on the unceded land of the Lenape people. We studied within the computational and historical lineage of Bell Labs which occupied that space many years before. We’re in search of new temporary and permanent space.

                                        SFPC offered classes and events at its space on 155 Bank Street, hosted by the WestBeth. 155 Bank Street has a complex history of technological innovation, military operations and creative arts. The building was the Bell Telephone Laboratories Headquarters, as well as the Manhattan Project, which led the development of the first Nuclear weapon during WWII. Later on, historical engineers such as Claude Shannon “The Father of Information Age” worked at the Bell Labs in the building. There’s also a record of Alan Turing visiting and working in the building for a short while. Since the 1970s, WestBeth Artists Community, a nonprofit housing and commercial complex, has offered live and work spaces for artists and organizations. Contemporary artists such as Merce Cunningham, Martha Graham and others involved in Fluxus, Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T) and various New York art movements lived or worked at WestBeth. SFPC has been fortunate to be a tenant of the WestBeth. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, SFPC has not offered events or classes onsite.
