                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">The Dark Matters course, my classmates, and our teachers gave me a perspective on computing that I'm not sure I could have found anywhere else. We connected computing to the environment, colonialism, ecology and policing, and explored what actual liberatory technology might look like. It's been almost two years and the readings and conversations still come back to me often.
                         <h4>Angus Fletcher, Summer 2020</h4></figure>
                         <figure class="block-text test hide-test">The readings were incredible. The curriciulum was really expansive and offered a perspective I hadn't heard with this much depth, and I recommend a lot of the articles and books from the class to many of my friends.
                            <h4>Paras Sanghavi, Summer 2020</h4></figure>
                     <figure class="block-text test hide-test">Coming into SFPC as a programmer, I was surprised to find American Artist’s critical theory class the most intellectually challenging and rewarding of my SFPC experience. The readings and discussions helped me reexamine my long-held assumptions about technology and inspired my artistic practice. Anyone who works in technology should take this class.
                       <h4>Alex Miller, Spring 2019</h4></figure>
                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">As someone coming from an engineering educational background, the course was one of my first experiences having critical discussions about technology, race, theory, and more in a group setting. Dark Matters was rigorous in all of the right ways and it has left a lasting impact on the way I think, research, and write.
                       <h4>Bomani Oseni McClendon, Spring 2019</h4></figure>
                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">Taking this class gave me such a vital vocabulary and lens for looking at computing and power. American’s carefully chosen readings and the discussions we had were my introduction to talking to others about technology critically. I can’t imagine how anyone can consider a computer science education complete without understanding the topics covered in this course. A total once-in-a-lifetime experience!
                         <h4>Olivia Ross, Fall 2019</h4></figure>
                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">It’s easy to forget that the computers, interfaces, algorithms, and hardware that are so integrated in our entityal and professional lives were made by people with inherent biases. I found Dark Matters to be invaluable in encouraging a critical mindset and discussion, and peeling back the complicated histories of some of the ubiquitous technologies that we take for granted.
                         <h4>Shelby Wilson, Fall 2019</h4></figure>
                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">Critical Theory was eye-opening to me after having majored in computer engineering and worked in tech for a couple years. It made me rethink my relationship with technology and should be a required curriculum for anybody working with computers.

                          History of SFPC, community agreement, learning objectives, about the final project, meet the participants
                          <li><b>Week 2: Transparency</b> —
                          We will be looking at the origin of computer interfaces and how they obscure reality, compared to a traditional model of ideology.
                          <li><b>Week 3: Ground</b> —
                          This discussion will focus on the origins of settler colonialism in the Western United States and the preface to modern-day Silicon Valley.
                          <li><b>Week 4: Interface</b> —
                          This week begins with a critical reconsideration of computer design, and what a decolonial technology might look like.
                          <li><b>Week 5: Watching</b> —
                          We will begin considering the origins of surveillance technology in the United States, and its roots in racial capitalism.
                          <li><b>Week 6: Being</b> —
                          Building on the previous week, we will unpack how the body as data is related to the legacy of racial slavery.
                          <li><b>Week 7: Calculation</b> —
                          We will learn about the origins of scientific racism as well as the evolution of Ancestral DNA tracing as a commercial phenomenon.
                          <li><b>Week 8: Accumulation</b> —
                          This week’s discussion is an overview of neoliberal economic practices in America, the normalization of debt, and the expansion of policing and incarceration.
                          <li><b>Week 9: Prediction</b> —
                          Building on the previous discussion we will look at how the Military, University, High Tech sector, and Police came together to create a perfect data storm.
                          <li><b>Week 10: Graduation</b> —
                          We will be sharing our work with the community through a Zoom event.

                            <li>Over the course of the 10 weeks, we will be working on a collaborative publication relating to themes discussed in class, and by the end of the class we will publish this as a digital publication containing original contributions from every member of the class.
