This is a diversion from many of our previous experiences with sex advice columns, which privileged the production of knowledge around sex to singular voices of authority.

                      <p class="medium">
                        The School for Poetic Computation proudly presents, SFPC: Sex Ed, a pleasure and queer centered experiment in shared study and epistemic empowerment.

                        This program is a direct response to creating the kinds of educational spaces we never had, but always sought. Many of us would benefit from actively determining our own sex education outside of systemic governing bodies like the state, public and private schools, or legal guardians, as well as interpersonal relationships like the person(s) who you're having sex with. Everyone deserves platonic and friendly spaces to learn and explore sexuality and pleasure informed by cultural understandings of sex, gender, class and race and how our identities relate to sexual desires, practices and kink.
