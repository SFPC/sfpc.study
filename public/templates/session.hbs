                          At the core of SFPC is a self-reflexive prompt: What is poetic computation? Each convening of SFPC community members has a new opportunity to respond to this prompt with definition, interpretation, critique, embodied practice. This spring, SFPC returns to the core, inviting you to facilitate new possibilities for this question. 
          <br><BR>
          What is Poetic Computation? What would technology feel like if it were designed by people who love us? How are the histories and presences of racialized oppression embedded in the jargon of hardware and software? Where is the poetry and satire in the ways power structures reveal themselves on the internet? How can we activate the imagination as a tool that can shape our present and open portals into the future, grounded in Black and Indigenous traditions of science and storytelling?
          <br><BR>
          Poetic Computation is a prompt with a deep past, many presences, and infinitely possible futures. Join our incredible group of teachers to play in these timelines, practice writing in poetry, prose, and code, and help redefine (always again) what poetic computation can be.

My favorite moments included the smaller group discussions that often led to deeper connections and learnings with peers and teachers.

                          <figure class="block-text test hide-test">SFPC's classes provided exactly the kind of learning experience at the intersection of art and coding that I was looking for. It was a fantastic and enriching experience, with knowledgeable teachers who create a supportive and stimulating environment for everyone.

                        <figure class="block-text test hide-test">After SFPC, I now have a stronger art practice with new technologies and tools to continue experimenting with. I’m a part of a greater community of folks working with art and technology who I can collaborate with, get inspired by, and meet across the world and for years to come.

                        <figure class="block-text test hide-test">The whole SFPC experience was surreal. It felt unlike anything I’ve ever done. It was a magical space that let me explore concepts that I otherwise would not have had the time to think about. It makes a strong case for a more radically community-oriented model of pedagogy and living life that feels more complete, enriching, sustainable, and ultimately more hopeful.

                        <figure class="block-text test hide-test">SFPC is the purest, most honest exchange of knowledge and experience among peers I have ever experienced. It is a supportive space where everyone learns from everyone, and bridges are built that continue to be strengthened for years to come. You won’t get a certificate or a title at the end of it, but I would be amazed if you ever looked at your world the same again. I haven’t.
