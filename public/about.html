                        The School for Poetic Computation is an experimental school in New York that was founded in 2013. Our school supports interdisciplinary study in art, code, hardware and critical theory. It is a place for unlearning and learning.
                        <BR><BR>
                        Our programs challenge the capitalistic, heteronormative and patriarchal canon of social and computer sciences. SFPC attracts self-motivated creative thinkers and radical teachers. All participants are treated as collaborators and we formally encourage the power of learners to determine their experience & education. The unique culture of our institution is one based on communal care and solidarity across social differences. This pedagogical space framed in intimacy ideally allows for participants that are LGBTQIA+, Black, Indigenous, and/or Disabled to feel empowered that their ideas are important, necessary and central.
                        <BR><BR>
                        <i>Note: Our school has been undergoing significant transformation since 2020.

                        We seek to put together a cohort of people with diverse backgrounds and interests who will have a lot to offer to each other as peers. We center people from identities and backgrounds that are often excluded from art, technology, and higher education spaces, and look for a cohort with a wide range of passions, skills, experiences, and technical abilities. Above all, we look for openness to building a shared experience around learning, critical theory, art making, and technology.

                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">I appreciated the empathy, care, and patience of instructors & classmates, especially as we all were trying to navigate personal and community crises during an ongoing pandemic. My favorite moments included the smaller group discussions that often led to deeper connections and learnings with peers and teachers.

                         <figure class="block-text test hide-test">SFPC's classes provided exactly the kind of learning experience at the intersection of art and coding that I was looking for. It was a fantastic and enriching experience, with knowledgeable teachers who create a supportive and stimulating environment for everyone.

                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">After SFPC, I now have a stronger art practice with new technologies and tools to continue experimenting with. I’m a part of a greater community of folks working with art and technology who I can collaborate with, get inspired by, and meet across the world and for years to come.
                         <h4>Mathilde Mouw-Rao</h4></figure>
                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">The whole SFPC experience was surreal. It felt unlike anything I’ve ever done. It was a magical space that let me explore concepts that I otherwise would not have had the time to think about. It makes a strong case for a more radically community-oriented model of pedagogy and living life that feels more complete, enriching, sustainable, and ultimately more hopeful.

                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">It is a very therapeutic and rare experience to find a place where you’re able to re-examine your technical knowledge and how it relates to your place in the world and the future you want to make.

                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">SFPC is filled with amazing people and an open mindset to learning, and doing. It has taught me different ways of thinking, ones that I would be sure to bring back to my endeavors outside of the art world.

                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">SFPC is the purest, most honest exchange of knowledge and experience among peers I have ever experienced. It is a supportive space where everyone learns from everyone, and bridges are built that continue to be strengthened for years to come. You won’t get a certificate or a title at the end of it, but I would be amazed if you ever looked at your world the same again. I haven’t.

                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">I'm half way through the program and I'm already missing being here. SFPC was a much needed breath of fresh air in my hectic creative existence, an unlikely place to stop and remind myself what was it I was into in the first place.

                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">SFPC is the best place you can explore your interest as much as you want and the place you start to write your own poem.

                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">SFPC is not really a school or a course — it is more like a door into an extraordinary world. It is driven by passion, kindness and the thrill of teaching and learning. I would love to live those inspiring weeks all over again.

                       <figure class="block-text test hide-test">School For Poetic Computation is equal parts The Factory, childhood blanket fort, and mad scientist's lab. I learned a ton from the teachers and the whole SFPC community in a huge collaborative and exploratory environment.

                        The School for Poetic Computation does not currently have a physical location and since Spring 2020 we have been operating and learning online as we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. From 2015 to 2020, we were located in the Westbeth Artists Community of West Village, New York City, on the unceded land of the Lenape people. We studied within the computational history lineage of Bell Labs that occupied that space many years before. We are in search for a new temporary and permanent space; please <a href="">contact us</a> if you have any leads!

                                  <p>Zainab "Zai" Aliyu is an artist and cultural worker whose work is about the material affect of the "immaterial." She contextualizes the cybernetic and temporal entanglement embedded within societal dynamics to understand how all sociotechnological systems of control are interconnected, and how we are all implicated through time. She often dreams, experiments and inquires through built virtual environments, printed matter, video, archives, writing, installation and community-participatory (un)learning.
                                    Zai is currently a 2022 fellow at NYU Tisch's Future Imagination Collaboratory, design director for the African Film Festival at the Film at Lincoln Center in NYC, a co-director of the School for Poetic Computation, and is tending to her creative practice at a collective studio warehouse named Soft Surplus.

                        If you can’t pay full tuition, we really still want you to apply. Our application will ask you how much you can pay. We will offer subsidized positions in all of our classes, once each one has enough participants enrolled that we’re able to do so.
                      </p>
                      <p>We have also started a <a href="">scholarship fund</a>, and we will be offering additional scholarships as community members <a href="">redistribute their wealth</a> through SFPC.
                      We direct scholarship funds towards participants who are low-income, Black, Indigenous, racialized, gendered, disabled, Queer, trans, oppressed, historicially excluded and underrepresented.
                    </p><p>
                            Right now, tuition is SFPC’s main source of income, and that is a problem. It means that we can only pay teachers, pay for space, and organize programs when participants pay full tuition to attend. Tuition is a huge barrier to entry into the SFPC community, and it disproportionately limits Black participants, indigenous participants, queer and trans participants, and other people who are marginalized, from participating. Scholarships are not a long term solution for us, but in the short and medium term we hope to offer them more while we work towards transforming SFPC’s financial model.

                      <p>We are so thankful to our generous donors and members for supporting scholarships in such a direct way. For SFPC to be the kind of place the community has always meant it to be, it needs to become a platform for wealth redistribution. If you are a former participant, prospective participant, or friend of the school, and you have the financial privilege to do so, <a href="">please donate generously</A>. There is enough wealth in this community to make sure no one is ever rejected because of their inability to pay, and becoming that school will make SFPC the impactful, imaginative, transformative center of poetry and justice that we know it can be. We know that inside this community there is more capacity for mutual aid and redistribution, and we are always looking for help elsewhere.
